Python Twitter Replica
Olivia O'Dwyer

My routes are: 
	/ (splash page)
	home/ (home page)
	profile/ (profile page)
	login/ (to login)
	signup/ (to signup)
	accounts/ (login / signup page)
	hashtag/ (contains each page of hashtags and related tweets)
	delete 	 (to delete a tweet)
	like	(to like a tweet)

One note: when you write a tweet, the hashtag may not immediately appear under Trending Hashtags; once you refresh the page, the hashtag should be there! 

To run the server, download the files, cd to the folder that it is in, and run: 
	python3 manage.py runserver 

requirements.txt contains any third party packages used
